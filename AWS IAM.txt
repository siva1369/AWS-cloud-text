AWS IAM:- (Identity and Access Management)
------------------------------------------

IAM is the AWS Identity and Access Management Service.

IAM is used to securely control individual and group access to AWS resources.

IAM makes it easy to provide multiple users secure access to AWS resources.

AWS IAM allows you to Create users, groups, and roles. Define permissions using policies, Control who can do what in your AWS account

Main Components:-
----------------

1. IAM Users:- Represents an individual person or application.

Has long-term access credentials (username + password or access keys).


2. IAM Groups:- A collection of users with shared permissions.

Makes it easy to manage permissions for multiple users (e.g., Dev team, QA team).


3. IAM Roles:- Used for services or temporary access.

Assumed by AWS services (like EC2, Lambda) or federated users.

No username or password â€” trusted entities assume the role.

it is helpful to establish the communication between AWS services like ec2, s3, lambda, DynamoDB, etc..



4. IAM Policies:- JSON-based documents that define permissions. Attached to Users, Groups, or Roles.

Two types:

AWS Managed Policies (predefined)

Customer Managed Policies (custom)


Example:


{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": "s3:*",
  "Resource": "*"
}




5. Permission Boundaries:- Sets the maximum permissions a role or user can have. Useful in large teams to restrict over-permission.



6. IAM Policy Simulator:- Tool to test and validate IAM permissions before applying. Helps avoid misconfigurations.
