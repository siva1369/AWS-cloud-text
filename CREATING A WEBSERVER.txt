FOR CREATING A WEBSERVER:-   (HTTPD WEB SERVER)



Lanch new EC2 machine....



	Step 1 == Select AMI(Amazon Machine Image) -->> select amazon linux

	Step 2 == configure the instance -->> choose t2.micro.

	Step 3 == choose No.of instances  -->> choose  1 instance.

	Step 4 == Storage -->> 30GB (Observe we have root  it is like a Drive)

	Step 5 == Add Tag -->>  Giving name to the machine. value -->> my windows. 
			
	Step 6 == Security group  -->> It deals with ports. by defolt it will take.(RDP for windowa SSH FOR linux)
 
    StEP 7 ==	review & lanch.

              Create a new keypair -->>  download key pair -->> launch instance.





IN LOCAL MACHINE:-

NOTE:-

Credentials required for windows machines IS DNS,USER NAME and PASSWORD.in local machine 'Remote Desktop Connection'.

FOR LINUX MACHINE :- We have multiple ways to connect linux 

1 way :- By using 'PUTTY' terminal.

putty required ppk file ( Putty private key ).


2 way :- By using 'GIT BASH' terminal.

git bash requires pem file .



IN CLOUD :-

for connecting linux machine ...navigation...

select machine -->> connect -->> SSH clint -->> take ssh command. (copy the command).



THAN ....in local system ..

 take any terminal git bash or putty... past the ssh command ... it will connect.


OBSERVATION:- 

in terminal we can able to observe the small change that is 'IP address ' that means we are connected our cloud server.

 

>> for creating a web server we need to install some web packages (software).


>> run this commands in the terminal ( linux machine )...for installing the web package.



$ sudo su

# yum update -y

# yum install httpd -y

# cd /var/www/html

# echo "write any name" > index.html

# service httpd start

# chkconfig httpd on  



>> Now Our Linux machine is webserver.

>> Now we able to access the web pages ?



IN CLOUD:-

select instance -->> under detail -->> take public IP.

Copy the public IP and paste in browser...

We are unable to access... because we are not select the HTTP port that's why we cannot able to web server.

Browser communicates using http port.

We should also open http port.



>> Lets open http port:-


IN AWS Dashboard -->> security groups -->> Select our security group --> Inbound Edit --> Add rule

Select Type = HTTP -->> Save.

Observation: We get two entries for HTTP port.

One for ipv4 and other for ipv6.



>> Now Lets trying to access the web page ....take public IP ... past in the browser..


>> Yes... now we can able to access the web page...
