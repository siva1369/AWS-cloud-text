EC2 ==>> ECC ==>> Elastic  compute cloud.


>> Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud provides scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud.
>> Using Amazon EC2 eliminates your need to invest in hardware up front.
>> so we can develop and deploy applications faster. 


>> EC2 using as a Computer, machine, storage box, PC, Server,etc....  
>> As per AWS terminalogy we can call it as 'Instance'.



>> As a new AWS user we need to make this options for better experience.

 1: Login to AWS  
 2: Choose region which is nearestone , as per india region chose 'Asia pacific - Mumbai'.

>> for lanching EC2 machine we have seven step process.

navigation for EC2:-

  services ==>> under compute service ==>> EC2. ( lanch instance ).

     
      Note:- Select free tier eligible.


Example 1:- Launch windows instnace.


	Step 1 == Select AMI(Amazon Machine Image) -->> select windows server.

	Step 2 == configure the instance -->> choose t2.micro.

	Step 3 == choose No.of instances  -->> choose  1 instance.

	Step 4 == Storage -->> 30GB (Observe we have root  it is like a Drive)

	Step 5 == Add Tag -->>  Giving name to the machine. value -->> my windows. 
			
	Step 6 == Security group  -->> It deals with ports. by defolt it will take.(RDP port)

			       We have 0 to 65535  ports.Every port is dedicated to special purpose.

			RDP   ==> 3389
			SSH   ==> 22
			HTTP  ==> 80
			HTTPS ==> 443
			
		NOTE:- For windows machine we need to open RDP port  ( Remote Desktop Protocol ).
			
			
	 StEP 7 ==	review & lanch.

              Create a new keypair -->>  download key pair -->> launch instance.

              We get the instance ID ,view Instance. 

          now.. our windows machine is created in AWS cloud.


 Now.. the new windows machine is having its own DNS ID ,Username and password.


We need to provide all the above 3 details in our local system. We use an application called 'Remote Desktop Connection'.


 
IN AWS :- navigation for connecting machine. 

         choose machine -->> take 'connect' option -->> select 'RDP clint'

         under that,      DNS ID = copy that one 
                       USER NAME = copy that one 
                        PASSWORD = get password   -->> upload .pem file -->> copy password.

    NOTE :- copy these 3 prerequisites for connecting cloud windows machine.




IN LOCAL SYSTEM :- 
                   
                  in our local system 'Remote Desktop Connection'. OPEN...



                            Computer ==>> give DNS ID.

                           User name ==>> give user name (Administrator).
                            password ==>> give password .


                   >>>>  Observe.....we are connected....



NOTE:-

>> Lets check the hardware configuration
>> CHeck hard disk
>> Check Ram


You can copy and paste the files from localsystem to cloud server.... 


FOR DISCONNECT:- in local system....

To disconnect just close the remote desktop window.




FOR TERMINATION :- in AWS

after completion of our practice just termenate the instance...to avoid the bill...

select instance -->> instance status -->> terminate instance...
