on-prem to aws cloud migration:-  
-------------------------------- 

now we are going to do server migration on-prem to cloud using application migration servie (MGN).

In the process of migration we have multipule methods those are 

1. Rehosting (lift and shift)
 
2. Replotforming (lift ,tinker and shift)

3. Refactoring (Re-architecting)

4. Repurchaging (software as a service)

5. Retaining

6. Retiring


In this migration we are using rehosting method means lift-and-shift method it means the process of moving the application with out any change.



1. first we need to create the infrastucture for the open shift application like vpc,subnets,RT,and networking parts.

on-prem server we call it as source server or source mechine


2. than we need to creat one IAM user , user should have admistrative access give permissions like that. 

take access key and secrat access key from that.

access key =
secrat access key =

3. than go to aws console choase a service called "aws application migration service" (MGN)

just follow the following steps for create agent

click mgn >> get started >>source servers >> add server >> 

here 

> select operating system

linux/windows

> disk selection

better go to all disks

>give both access key and secret access key 

than teke agent download command run in the source mechine, agent get downloaded in that 
after that take agent run command process in source mechine.

after few minitus you get success messsage in you source mechine then source mechine apper in the mgn portal.


data get synking we can observe in the portal 

in the portal first colaum shows a next step process, when it show the next step just click in to that .

those options are in the actions tab just click the actions tab we can able to see the next steps.

for the compatabulity and testing purpose 2 or 3 mechines get launched and terminated thats not a issue finally get one mechine that is final product or archive mechine.
