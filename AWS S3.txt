Amazon S3 :- (simple storage service)
--------------------------------------

Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the Internet.

It’s a simple storage service that offers an extremely durable, highly available, and infinitely scalable data storage infrastructure at very low costs.

Amazon S3 is a distributed architecture and objects are redundantly stored on multiple devices across multiple facilities (AZs) in an Amazon S3 region.

Amazon S3 is a simple key-based object store.


Lifecycle – define an object’s lifecycle.

Website – configuration for hosting static websites.

Versioning – retain multiple versions of objects as they are changed.

Access Control Lists (ACLs) – control permissions access to the bucket.

Bucket Policies – control access to the bucket, Bucket policies are limited to 20 KB in size.

Transfer acceleration - Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and your Amazon S3 bucket.

Server-side encryption options - Server-side encryption protects data at rest.

Event Notifications - Amazon S3 event notifications can be sent in response to actions in Amazon S3 like PUTs, POSTs, COPYs, or DELETEs,Amazon S3 event notifications enable you to run workflows, send alerts, or perform other actions in response to changes in your objects stored in S3.

Object Tags - S3 object tags are key-value pairs applied to S3 objects which can be created, updated, or deleted at any time during the lifetime of the object.

Cross Region Replication - CRR is an Amazon S3 feature that automatically replicates data across AWS Regions, With CRR, every object uploaded to an S3 bucket is automatically replicated to a destination bucket in a different AWS Region that you choose, Provides automatic, asynchronous copying of objects between buckets in different regions, CRR is configured at the S3 bucket level.

S3 Inventory - You can use S3 Inventory to audit and report on the replication and encryption status of your objects for business, compliance, and regulatory needs.





Bucket = 5TB max size

Object = 5GB max size

100 buckets per account by default.

services-->> storage -->> S3

1 create the bucket
